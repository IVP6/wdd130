        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Ivan Padron;I am from Houston, Texas.</p>
        <p>At first I was scared of coding because it looks too complicated, now, I love learning how to code anything
            and everything! So far this is fun.
        </p>
        <p>I love D.I.Y. projects, gaming, and art. I spend most of my time at work, in my calling at church, in
            school, or with my wife in the picture.
        </p>

        <p>Texas is the second largest state in the United States by both area and population. It is known for oil and
            gas
            production, cattle ranching, and a rich cultural heritage that blends Mexican and American influences. Major
            cities include Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio.</p>
